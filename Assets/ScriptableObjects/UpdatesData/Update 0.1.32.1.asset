  <ShortDescription>k__BackingField: 1)  Hotfix to prevent game from entering a locked
    state when selecting an older playlist and environment.
  <Description>k__BackingField: 1)  Fixed bug causing the game to get into a locked
    state requiring players to restart the game when selecting a playlist created
    prior to version 0.1.32 using a custom environment created prior to 0.1.32. This
    was caused by an oversight in attempting to load the previous data resulting
    in unexpected results.

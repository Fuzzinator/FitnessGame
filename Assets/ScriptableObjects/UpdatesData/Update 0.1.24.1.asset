  <Description>k__BackingField: "1)  Fixed issue causing profile editor to display
    multiple screens at once. Fixed bug causing profile selection to activate when
    returning from a workout. Fixed bug causing profile settings to be reset or not
    set at all when updating or creating a new profile.\n\n2) Average strike speed
    when missed is now added to the total instead of subtracted from causing the
    average speed to be less volatile and less likely to reduce to 0 over time.\n\n3)
    Added option to change minimum strike speed between 1.5-10. Default is 1.5 meters
    per second. This setting can be found under the Gameplay Settings tab. \n\t\u2022Due
    to the increase in settings, the Gameplay Settings are now in a scrollable field.\n\n4)
    PCVR Virtual Keyboard hovered and un-hovered sound effects removed."

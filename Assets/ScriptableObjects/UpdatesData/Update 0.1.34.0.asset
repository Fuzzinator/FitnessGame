    2)
    Stance changes during songs!


    3) Bug fixes'
  <Description>k__BackingField: "1)  Re-worked beatmaping algorithm to ensure a better
    flow and balanced workout. \n\t\u2022 Directional targets will now always appear
    on the side opposite of the previous target allowing more fluid movement. \n\t\u2022
    Decreased maximum number of targest allowed on the same side ensuring both sides
    get a great workout!\n\r\n2) Player stance now changes during songs!\n\t\u2022
    Whenever a song is at least 1.55 minutes long, stance change events will occur.\n\t\u2022
    Stance change events currently occur once every minute.\n\t\u2022 When a stance
    change event fires, the choreography will pause for 5 seconds during which time
    it will show the stance change indicator. \n\r\n3) Bug Fixes:\r\n\t\u2022 Improved
    handing of cancelled delayed events preventing errors to be logged with it is
    already being handled.\n\t\u2022 Fixed issue causing custom songs page to sometimes
    throw an error when trying to scroll due to a cancelled token."

  <Description>k__BackingField: "1) <b>Super Strike Targets!</b> Some targets will
    now appear with an additional glow around them. In order to successfully hit
    them, players are required to strike the targets with much more force. This will
    help add some additional variance, keep players on their toes, and help improve
    the workout!\n\n2) Added descriptions to Target Side Mode settings during profile
    editing.\n\n3) Bug fixes and improvements. \n\t\u2022 Fixed bug causing targets
    to sometimes get repooled prematurely resulting in a registered miss.\n\t\u2022
    Fixed bug causing some songs to not give the option to select target difficulty.\n\t\u2022
    Improved feel for striking hooks and uppercuts. Increased collider size slightly
    resulting in improved hit detection.\n\t\u2022 Dodge obstacles now require more
    movement. They are slightly closer to the middle resulting in requiring the player
    to move out of the way more.\n\t\u2022 Targets appearing during a dodge obstacle
    will be forced to the opposing hand for a more natural experience."

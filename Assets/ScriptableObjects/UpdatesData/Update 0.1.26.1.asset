    1) Improved creating and updating playlist

    2) Bug fixes'
  <Description>k__BackingField: "1) Improved creating and updating playlist workflow.
    If players select home button after making changes they will be prompted to save
    before returning.\n\t\u2022 Updating a playlist will no longer create duplicate
    playlist.\n\t\u2022 When playlists are updated, they maintain their sorted position.\n\n2)
    Bug fixes.\n\t\u2022 Song previews stop loading when returning to main menu.\n\t\u2022
    Fixed issue causing an error to be thrown when deleting a playlist from the view
    playlist page.\n\t\u2022 Improved custom song support to support songs that by
    default do not have a normal mode but do have a one handed mode. This removes
    infinite loading screen after downloading them."

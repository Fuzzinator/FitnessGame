  <Description>k__BackingField: "1)  Started implementing player statistics tracking.
    Total number of hit targets, their hit quality, and dodged obstacles is now recorded
    in player profile for future use in achievements.\n\n2) Improved obstacle visuals.
    \n\t\u2022 Added visual feedback to getting hit by obstacles. The screen will
    now flash the color of the obstacle when your head collides with obstacles.\n\t\u2022
    Space arena obstacles now have transparency.\n\n3) Improved audio settings by
    changing how it is mixed and controlled. \n\t\u2022Menu music and menu sound
    effects are now controlled completely separately from game music and game sound
    effects. \n\t\u2022Sound effects now duck music considerably more to ensure they
    can be heard even during loud points in game music."

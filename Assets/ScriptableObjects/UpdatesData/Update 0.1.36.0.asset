    1) Auto generating local mp3 songs!

    Bug fixes'
  <Description>k__BackingField: "1) Mp3 files stored in your downloads folder can
    now be automatically converted into Shadow BoXR supported songs.\n\t\u2022 The
    current implementation is powered by BeatSage and does require an active internet
    connection. This is primarily to improve in game performance and allow song conversion
    without interrupting gameplay.\n\n3) Bug Fixes:\r\n\t\u2022 Fixed bug causing
    sound settings and target FPS to revert to their default values upon startup.\n\t\u2022
    Fixed bug causing the playlist maker tool to return an error sometimes when saving
    an empty list or causing it to say changes have been made when the list is empty.\n\t\u2022
    Fixed bug causing community songs to sometimes throw an error when attempting
    to download a community song.\n\t\u2022 Fixed bug causing environment and game
    mode overrides to reset when playing a single song.\n\t\u2022 Fixed bug causing
    songs being previewed in the workout editing menu to continue to play after closing
    or moving to a different menu."
